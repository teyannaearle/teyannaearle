## Hello, I'm Teyanna üëãüèΩ
A Queens native, Full stack Web developer, who studied at an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship, called Pursuit, with a 9% acceptance rate. Proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node, PostgreSQL, Redux.js, React.js, Git and Github.

I am a free-spirited individual who believes that all people are entitled to balance within their lives and the opportunity to live a life that makes them happy. As a family-oriented person, it is important for me to create tools that will help adults and children alike in a multitude of ways. Whether it is assisting young children educationally, with the development of their morality and behavior towards others, nurturing the enhancement of their imagination; or connecting older kids and adults with the resources/tools that can help them de-stress, get organized and/or help improve their overall sense of wellness. The aim is to help whomever I can, in this way, because I care about my wellness, your wellness and everyone else's wellness too!

Outside of web development, I like to watch all different genres of movies and television shows. I‚Äôm a big fan of Disney! I also enjoy cooking, listening to music, dancing, going to theme parks, and doing guided-meditations. A lot of my free time is spent looking up and trying out new ways to care for/style my naturally curly hair and attempting to implement more natural products into my beauty routine.
